	abstract = {Data-driven approaches for creating virtual patient dialogue systems require the availability of large data specific to the language,domain and clinical cases studied. Based on the lack of dialogue corpora in French for medical education, we propose an annotatedcorpus of dialogues including medical consultation interactions between doctor and patient. In this work, we detail the building processof the proposed dialogue corpus, describe the annotation guidelines and also present the statistics of its contents. We then conducted aquestion categorization task to evaluate the benefits of the proposed corpus that is made publicly available.},
